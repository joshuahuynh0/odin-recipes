        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            It's always a great feeling when a recipe comes out well, 
            but there's a little extra satisfaction involved when it's 
            something that's usually fried, and we've been able to 
            successfully pull it off in the oven. These chicken 
            empanadas were a perfect example. Despite not firing up 
            the deep fryer, they were crispy, flaky, and baked up to 
            a beautiful golden brown.

            So, the packaging was great, but that's only half the battle. 
            To make a truly great empanada we need a very flavorful filling, 
            which I think we accomplished here, plus we want a lot of it. 
            By weight, these empanadas have twice as much chicken mixture 
            as crust, which I think is the perfect ratio. To accomplish 
            this, we really need to push the envelope when we…stuff the 
            "envelope." As long as you can seal these up, they can't have 
            too much stuffing.

            And yes, that means you may get some juices bubbling out 
            of the seams towards the end of the baking, but this 
            shouldn't be an issue, since our filling is so moist that 
            there's very little chance of things drying out. Speaking 
            of not dry, I'd like to think these are perfectly fine to 
            eat by themselves, but if you were to mix fresh lime juice 
            and cilantro into some sour cream, you'd have a fast and 
            easy dip that I thought worked really well. Either way, 
            I really do hope you give these a try soon.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour olive oil into a saucepan; add onion, 
                poblano, garlic, salt, pepper, chipotle, 
                cumin, oregano, cayenne, and cooked chicken, 
                pressing down as you go. Add currants.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place saucepan over high heat; cook until onions
                begin to soften slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir 
                in diced tomatoes with green chiles. Pour in 1/3 
                cup water and mix to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring mixture to a simmer; reduce heat to medium 
                and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquids are 
                cooked down, 30 to 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, 
                about 30 minutes. Chill thoroughly before use, 1 to 
                2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                While filling simmers, combine flour, salt, and sugar 
                for dough in a bowl with your hand. Grate in cold butter, 
                pausing as needed to combine. Drizzle in beaten egg and 
                water. Mix with a fork until it starts to form a shaggy 
                dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use your hands to squeeze mixture into a lump of dough; 
                transfer to a work surface and knead into a ball of 
                dough, 10 to 15 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at 
                least 1 hour, up to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F 
                (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unwrap chilled dough and transfer to a lightly floured 
                work surface. Use a bench scraper to divide into 8 equal 
                pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll each dough piece into an 8-inch circle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain any excess juice from filling. Top each 
                dough circle with a rounded 1/2-cup measure of 
                the chicken mixture. Sprinkle some pepper Jack 
                cheese over top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Brush edges of each dough circle with a small 
                amount of water to dampen; fold over and seal 
                with fingertips, making sure to not trap in any 
                pockets of air. Crimp using your fingertips or a fork.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine beaten egg and 2 teaspoons water for egg wash. 
                Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheet and 
                brush over egg wash. Sprinkle with cayenne.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned 
                and crispy on the edges, about 35 minutes. Transfer to a 
                wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes before serving.
